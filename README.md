# Simple HTML Demo Application

This is a minimal web application designed to demonstrate the fundamental interaction between HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

*   **HTML:** Provides the structure (`index.html`).
*   **CSS:** Styles the presentation for readability and aesthetics (`styles.css`).
*   **JavaScript:** Handles user interaction (button click) and updates the DOM dynamically (`script.js`).

## Setup and Running

No complex build tools or servers are required. This application runs entirely client-side.

1.  Save all files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`) into a single folder.
2.  Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
3.  Click the "Click Me to Update Counter" button to see the JavaScript counter update the text in real-time.
